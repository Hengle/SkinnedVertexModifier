Skinned Mesh Modifier Example
=============================

This example shows how to modify vertex positions and recalculate normals of an
animating skinned mesh with a surface shader.

Why modifying vertices is difficult
-----------------------------------

Actually just modifying vertex positions with a surface shader is quite easy
with using a [custom vertex modification function][VertexModifier]. However,
recalculating normals after modification is difficult because usually a vertex
modifier doesn't know positions of their neighbor vertices.

In this example, we use a mesh converter that encodes positions of neighbor
vertices into texture coordinate attributes, so that we can reconstruct the
neighbor vertices in a vertex modifier.

How to reconstruct neighbor vertices
------------------------------------

If a mesh is completely rigid (not skinned), we can simply store positions of
neighbor vertices as 3D texture coodinates. This approach is not enough for
skinned meshes because neighbor vertices will be moved from original positions
by a skin deformation.

Instead of directly storing vertex positions, we convert them into tangent
spaces and store them into texture coordinate attributes. Then, we reconstruct
the positionos in deformed tangent spaces. Although this doesn't provide
accurate positions because of skewness of skin deformation, we can get a fairly
good approximation of them.

In this example, we use a further simplification; A given skinned mesh is flat
shaded and all vertices in it are separated (not shared between triangles).
Under this simplification, we can assume that the neighbor vertices are laying
on its tangent plane, and thus we can ignore the normal axis component.

We use [an editor script][EditorScript] that converts a mesh in build time. It
encodes neighbor vertices into UV2 and centroids into UV3.

Vertex modifier examples
------------------------

### Noise

[Shader source](https://github.com/keijiro/SkinnedVertexModifier/blob/master/Assets/SkinnedVertexModifier/Noise.shader).

This shader modifies vertex positions with gradients of a noise field. It
reconstructs neighbor vertices and applies the same modifier to them, then
recalculate the normal of the belonging triangle from the modified vertex
positions. Although this approach is not optimal because the modifier will be
applied to a same vertex for multiple times, it's faster and more memory-
efficient than doing same process on the CPU side.

### Shrink

[Shader source](https://github.com/keijiro/SkinnedVertexModifier/blob/master/Assets/SkinnedVertexModifier/Shrink.shader).

This shader modifies vertex positions toward centroid of belonging triangle.
